<h2>What are film capacitors?</h2>
<p><img src="https://eepower.com/uploads/education/film-capacitor.jpg" alt="film capacitors" /></p>
<p>Film capacitors are capacitors which use a thin plastic film as the dielectric. This film is made extremely thin using a sophisticated film drawing process. Once the film is manufactured, it may be metallized or left untreated, depending on the needed properties of the capacitor. Electrodes are then added and the assembly is mounted into a case which protects it from environmental factors. They are used in many applications because of their stability, low inductance and low cost. There are many types of film capacitors, including polyester film, metallized film, polypropylene film, PTFE film and polystyrene film. The core difference between these&nbsp;<a title="Types" href="https://eepower.com/capacitor-guide/types/" target="_blank">capacitor types&nbsp;</a>is the material used as the dielectric, and the proper dielectric must be chosen according to the application.</p>
<p>PTFE film capacitors, for example, are heat-resistant and used in aerospace and military technology, while metallized polyester film capacitors are used in applications that require long term stability at a relatively low. Cheaper plastics are used if cost is a bigger concern than performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Film capacitor definition</h2>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">A film capacitor is a capacitor that uses a thin plastic film as the dielectric. They are relatively cheap, stable over time and have low self-inductance and ESR, while some film capacitors can withstand large reactive power values.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<p>Film capacitors are widely used because of their superior characteristics. This capacitor type is not polarized, which makes them suitable for AC signal and power use.&nbsp; Film capacitors can be made with very high precision capacitance values, and they retain that value longer than other capacitor types. This means that the aging process is generally slower than in other capacitor types, such as the electrolytic capacitor. Film capacitors have a long shelf and service life, and are very reliable, with a very low average failure rate. They have low ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance), low self-inductance (ESL), and as a result very low dissipation factors. They can be made to withstand voltages in the kilovolt range and can provide very high surge current pulses. A special class of film capacitors, which is called power film capacitors is available, and this class of film capacitors can withstand reactive power in excess of 200 volt-amperes. These capacitors may have special screw-type terminals which can withstand high currents. Screw-type terminals replace soldered joints because power film capacitors sometimes need to be changed in the field. Unfortunately, their superior electrical properties and stability come at a price. Film capacitors are bulkier than their electrolytic equivalents, which means that limited SMT (Surface &ndash; Mount Technology) packages are available. They can also burst into flames if overloaded, but this characteristic is somewhat common among different capacitor types.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Construction and properties</h2>
<p>Film capacitors are made of a thin dielectric film which may or may not be metallized on one side. The film is extremely thin, with the thickness being under 1 &micro;m. After the film is drawn to the desired thickness, the film is cut into ribbons. The width of the ribbons depends on the capacity of the capacitor being produced. Two ribbons of film are wound together into a roll, which is often pressed into an oval shape so that it can fit into a rectangular case. This is important because rectangular components save precious space on the printed circuit board. Electrodes are added by connecting each of the two electrodes to one of the films. A voltage is applied to burn out any imperfections using the self-healing property of film capacitors. The case is then sealed using silicon oil to protect the film roll against moisture, and dipped in plastic to hermetically seal the interior.</p>
<p>Typical film capacitors have capacitances ranging from below 1nF to 30&micro;F. They can be made in voltage ratings as low as 50V, up to above 2kV. They can be manufactured for use in high-vibration automotive environments, high temperature environments and high-power applications. Film capacitors offer low losses and high efficiency while providing a long service life.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 500;"><strong>Features and Applications of Film Capacitors</strong></h2>
<p>Apart from the usual use of capacitors to accumulate the electric charges, the film capacitors offer other functions as well. The bipolar nature and exceptional frequency characteristics make them popular in&nbsp;<strong><strong>high-frequency circuits</strong></strong>. In general, the typical capacitance value for these capacitors lies in between&nbsp;<strong><strong>1nF to 30muF</strong></strong>. These little passive components can be made to have a&nbsp;<strong><strong>voltage rating as low as 50 V</strong></strong>&nbsp;and as high as 2kV, therefore it can be used in a wide range of applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the interesting facts is that these film capacitors use different types of plastic film as a dielectric. Each type of film provides a&nbsp;<strong><strong>different temperature and frequency characteristics</strong></strong>&nbsp;to the capacitor in general. Hence, with the right choice of dielectric one can choose the optimal solution for their needs in their circuits. For example, if you are looking for a film capacitor to be placed in a circuit meant for high power/high-frequency applications, like say, induction heaters, the&nbsp;<strong><strong>PP film capacito</strong></strong>r would be the best choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figure below shows the comparison between frequency and temperature characteristics of 4 different plastic film dielectrics namely PP, PPS, PEN, and PET. The only difference between these capacitors is the dielectric material and you can notice the change in temperature and frequency is quite apparent.</p>
<p>Film capacitors are known mainly for their&nbsp;<strong><strong>low dissipation factor, stable capacitance, and high insulation resistance&nbsp;</strong></strong>among others like negative temperature characteristics and high reliability.&nbsp;Therefore, they are popular choices for a wide range of applications. From simple sample/hold circuits for ADCs, oscillatory circuits, timers to finding a place in the coupling/decoupling units of high-end&nbsp;<strong><strong>power electronic circuits</strong></strong>, these film capacitors produce optimum performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These capacitors have replaced the use of ceramic and electrolyte capacitors in many circuits in automobile and industrial applications as well, over the past few decades. Let&rsquo;s compare the film capacitor with the other popular capacitors and get to know what makes them a better choice for certain applications.</p>
<p><strong>How is Film Capacitor different from Electrolytic Capacitor and Ceramic Capacitor?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The first difference which is quite evident between these three capacitors is the&nbsp;<strong><strong>type of dielectric used&nbsp;</strong></strong>and their construction. While the film capacitors use thin sheets of plastic films,&nbsp;<a href="https://components101.com/ceramic-capacitor-pinout-parameters-datasheet">ceramic capacitors</a>&nbsp;have sheets made out of ceramic material as the dielectric. Both of them are bipolar in nature. The&nbsp;<a href="https://components101.com/electrolytic-capacitor-pinout-datasheet">electrolytic capacitors</a>, on the other hand, have oxides acting as dielectric and are polar in nature.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The differences in their manufacturing and dielectrics have a huge impact on their performances. As already discussed, the plastic film/metalized film capacitors are&nbsp;<strong><strong>available in a wide range of capacitance values</strong></strong>. The ceramic capacitors, on the other hand, are ideal only for circuits that have low capacitance requirements. For particular applications like analog signal processing and audio circuits, the film capacitors are preferred over ceramic capacitors due to the&nbsp;<strong><strong>low distortion factor</strong></strong>&nbsp;which they offer. Also at high capacitances, ceramic capacitors tend to have&nbsp;<strong><strong>high nonlinearities</strong></strong>&nbsp;which affect the performance of the circuits.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For applications such as coupling/decoupling circuits, capacitors with high capacitance and a low cost are preferred. Therefore, both electrolytic and Film capacitors are good options to choose from. Another major factor that is considered while designing such circuits is the ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance) and ESL (Equivalent Series Inductance) value of the capacitor. As already discussed, Film capacitors have&nbsp;<strong><strong>better ESR and ESL value</strong></strong>&nbsp;and very less distortion factor when compared to electrolytic capacitors and are therefore preferred over aluminium electrolytic capacitors.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if we compare the&nbsp;<strong><strong>aging time&nbsp;</strong></strong>between these three capacitors, film capacitors tend to resist the wearing out stage for the longest time among them. This makes them a better choice for high voltage and high-frequency applications.</p>
