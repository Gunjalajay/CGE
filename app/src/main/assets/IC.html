<h1 style="text-align: center;">Integrated Circuits (ICs)</h1>
<p>Normally bipolar junction transistors, diodes and field effect transistors are commonly used electronics component in electronic circuit. These components are interconnected along with required resistors and capacitors to form an electronic circuit. This type of circuit is known as <strong>discrete circuit</strong> as each of the components can be separated from the circuit as when required. Nowadays there is a new trend of producing electronic circuit where on a semiconductor wafer numbers of diodes, transistors, and capacitors are permanently fabricated.</p>
<p>As the components in this type of electronic circuit are not separable that is integrated on the semiconductor wafer, this circuit is commonly referred to as an <strong>Integrated Circuit</strong>. <strong>IC</strong> is also popularly known as chip or microchip.</p>
<h2>Types of Integrated Circuits (ICs)</h2>
<p>There are two main types of integrated circuits: <strong>digital ICs</strong> or <strong>analog ICs</strong>. These types of ICs are discussed in detail below.</p>
<h3>Analog IC</h3>
<p>In this <strong>type of ICs</strong>, the input and output both signals are continuous. The output signal level depends upon the input signal level and the output signal level is a linear function of input signal level. <strong>Linear ICs</strong> or analog ICs are most commonly used as audio frequency amplifier and radio frequency amplifier. Op amps, voltage regulators, comparators and timers are also well-known examples of <strong>linear ICs</strong> or analog ICs.</p>
<h3>Digital IC</h3>
<p>The logic Gates, such as AND gate, OR gate, NAND gate, XOR gate, flip flops, counters; microprocessors are some well-known examples of <strong>digital ICs</strong>. These ICs operate with binary data such as either 0 or 1. Normally in digital circuit, 0 indicates 0 V and one indicate +5 V. Digital ICs are commonly used in many electronics projects, and are often available as added components to the top Arduino starter kits.</p>
<p>The main components of an IC are transistors. These transistors may be bipolar or field effect depending upon the applications of ICs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Advantages of integrated circuits (ICs)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>It is quite small in size practically around 20,000 electronic components can be incorporated in a single square inch of IC chip.</li>
    <li>Many complex circuits are fabricated in a single chip and hence this simplifies the designing of a complex electronic circuit. Also it improves the performance.</li>
    <li>Reliability of ICs is high</li>
    <li>These are available at low cost due to bulk production.</li>
    <li>ICs consume very tiny power.</li>
    <li>Higher operating speed due to absence of parasitic capacitance effect.</li>
    <li>Very easily replaceable from the mother circuit.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Disadvantages of integrated circuits (ICs) :</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Because of its small size, IC is unable to dissipate heat in required rate when current in it increased. That is why ICs are often damaged due to over current flowing through them.</li>
    <li>Inductors and Transformers cannot be incorporated in <strong>ICs</strong>.</li>
